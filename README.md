# Next Word Predictio

The Next Word Prediction project is a Java-based application that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the most likely next word in a given text or sentence. This project aims to improve text input experiences, assist in natural language processing tasks, and enhance user interactions with various applications.

## Features

- **Data-driven Predictions**: The Next Word Prediction model is trained on a large corpus of text data, enabling it to make accurate predictions based on the context and patterns found in the training data.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input text and receive real-time predictions for the next word, enhancing the typing experience and improving productivity.
- **Customization Options**: The Next Word Prediction model can be fine-tuned and customized based on specific domains or user preferences, allowing for personalized predictions that adapt to different writing styles or specialized vocabularies.
